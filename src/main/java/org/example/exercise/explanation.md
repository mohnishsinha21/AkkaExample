Explanation:
CoapRequestHandler: This is an Akka actor that processes CoAP requests. It logs the incoming request and can be extended to perform more complex processing.

AkkaCoapServer: This is the main class that initializes the Akka actor system and creates a CoAP server using the Eclipse Californium library. It adds a resource (example) to the server and defines how to handle GET requests by forwarding them to the Akka actor.

Run the Application:
Compile and run your application. The CoAP server will start, and you can send CoAP GET requests to coap://localhost:5683/example. The Akka actor will handle the requests, demonstrating the integration of CoAP and Akka.

Summary
By combining CoAP and Akka, you can build an IoT system that leverages CoAP’s lightweight messaging capabilities and Akka’s powerful concurrency model. This example provides a basic integration, which can be extended to include more complex request handling, additional CoAP methods, and enhanced fault tolerance using Akka’s supervision strategies.
